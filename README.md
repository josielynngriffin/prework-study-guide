# Project Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created for coding boot camp students going through the Prework. It contains basic notes to give introductions to topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
### How it Helped Me
By making the study guide, it helped me familiarize me with all of the topics it included both by taking my own notes on the prework to have content for the webpage and by taking me through the process of coding the webpage itself. I also learned the importance of version control and now feel comfortable using Git.
