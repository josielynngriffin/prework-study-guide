        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your HTML notes here:</li>
          <li>HTML creates the basic structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements that work together to provide content and a basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Elements can be types of content on a page (text, images, headers, lists), or they can be used to divide and describe the content on the page to browsers, other developers, and accessibility technology. These would be meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The html opening tag represents the root of the HTML document, and it's closing tag represents the end of the document.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title of a webpage and is very important to Search Engine Optimization.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The heading element displays headings larger and bolder, semantically signifying importance in code. They are ordered h1-h6, most significant to least.</li>
          <li> Lists can be formatted in HTML with the ordered list element (ol) and the unordered list element (ul). Both have list item elements (li).</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your CSS notes here:</li>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): A programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users, defining colors, aesthetic, visual layout, and organization. </li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>External CSS sheets are the most common and best practice. CSS is kept in a separate file linked to the html page, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns: A widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It follows the belief that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY): A coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code. CSS selectors can share stylings to keep code from becoming too repetitive.</li>

          <li>Git is an open source code management and version control system tool. We use it with GitHub, an online platform that pairs with Git to store, track, and aid collaboration with software projects.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add: add a file with changes to stage them for committing </li>
          <li>git add -A: commits all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "": commit a staged file with a detailed, brief commit message tracking the change made to the code</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes commits from the local repository to github</li>

          <li>A high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. The data is typically related in some way.</li>
          <li>An array index indicates the position of the element within the array. The first item is at index 0 and they follow a sequential order after that (0,1,2,3).</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes a code in a script. It executes linearly, top to bottom.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expressions remains true or not, if a conditon is met. </li>
          <li>For loops perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Functions are a set of defined instructions within a code block that tell a computer to do a task and have a unique name. The defined function can then be called in our code as often as we want to, and the function will not execute until it is called.</li>
